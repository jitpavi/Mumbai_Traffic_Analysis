# Project Name
## Traffic Analysis of Mumbai City in last 7 Days

#### -- Project Status: [Active]
It is still in Active mode as i am trying to explore the concepts of applying predictive modelling in this project.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to visualise the traffic data of Mumbai city in last 7 days for every hour in the form of a visualisation heatmap chart.

### Methods Used
* Data Exploration
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Pycharm
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
